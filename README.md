# Problem

We want to validate IP v4 addresses. Create a function that takes a string and return true if it is valid host assignable IP address and false if not.

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long and grouped into 4 one byte blocks separated by dotted-decimal notation. E.g.
192.168.1.1.

Most IP addresses ending in 0 represent the entire network segment and cannot be used as host addresses.
Most IP addresses ending in 255 represent a broadcast address and cannot be used as a host address.
There are exceptions, when using subnets, for the sake of this Kata **any address ending in 0 or 255 is not a valid host
address**.

ðŸš¨ We strongly recommend not using regular expressions to solve this kata.

#### Examples
|    IP Address   | Result |
|:----------------|:------:|
| 1.1.1.1         |  true  |
| 192.168.1.1     |  true  |
| 10.0.0.1        |  true  |
| 127.0.0.1       |  true  |
| 0.0.0.0         |  false |
| 255.255.255.255 |  false |
| 1.1.1.0         |  false |
| 10.0.1          |  false |
